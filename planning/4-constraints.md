Some boundaries around our project.

## External

 - Short time to build the homepage. Only one week for the developement phase.

## Internal: Involuntary

- I am not familiar with Figma.

- I still need to build a strong foundation of CSS.

## Internal: Voluntary

- Simple webpage without JavaScript interactivity.
